# React Portfolio (Static)
The static version of my react portfolio project. Data is populated in StuffJS. This was created to test heroku also to have an porfolio-ready-to-show.
The purpose of a dynamic version of this project is to test CMS capabilities with react also for practicing http requests, used Axios for the project.
